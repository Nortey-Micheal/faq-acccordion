## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

How to combine two background images.
Using an image as a background image is better than embedding the image.

```css
body {
  background-image: url(assets/images/background-pattern-desktop.svg),url(assets/images/favicon-32x32.png);
  background-position: top , bottom;
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat,repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

CSS styling the backgrounds


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background_shorthand.asp) - This helped me to apply and adjust the background images.
